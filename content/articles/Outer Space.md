# Internet’s Outer Space, the Next Frontier

Give free reign to your imagination and join me on an odyssey into outer space beyond the confines of the Internet.
Computing has been a repeated cycle of rapid development followed by a technological spasm which overwhelmed the former paradigm (whose progress never abated). Mainframe computing in the 1960’s was an exponentially expanding bubble whose inhabitants were intoxicated at being on the bleeding edge of the world’s leading technology until PCs arrived on the scene and the exploding PC bubble encompassed the still-expanding Mainframe bubble.

The above Mainframe-to-PC explosion model recurred with the PC-to-Web explosion and again with Web-to-mobile - concentric expanding bubbles, each vastly wider than its inner bubbles. Figuratively we could say that PCs were outer space to mainframes before they existed. No one dreamed of the immensity of the new realm about to appear. By the same token, the web was outer space to PCs and mobile too was outer space before it existed.

Every bubble was bounded by a figurative gravitational field in its time which the ensuing bubble broke free of. Could our rapidly expanding Internet universe with its billions of Internet of Things devices, 5th generation cellular and glittering array of new technologies on the doorstep become an inner bubble itself? The answer is a resounding yes, and soon. To understand how, look back at what the leap from one seemingly boundless universe into the next, ever larger one was based on.

Each wave was based on a new, smaller, less expensive, more accessible, more programmable computing platform. The number of new computing platforms becomes exponentially larger than those of the previous wave.

What computing platform could possibly be smaller, more ubiquitous, less expensive, more programmable and vastly outstrip the trillions of mobile and wireless devices in the world? See our presentation 5G cellular D2D RDMA clusters.

Cellular D2D can turn mobile/wireless device clusters into the next generation application platform.

Development of distributed apps over on-the-fly clusters in the cloud is rapidly gaining popularity, but today’s networking strata is sorely lacking for the job.

The widely used RDMA clustering model with verbs programming has been a standard in HPC data centers for decades. RDMA on mobile clusters is ideal for writing distributed applications with their own custom networking schemes.

### Clustering
- Devices can pool their cores and storage
- Devices can belong to multiple clusters simultaneously 
- Every cluster can (optionally) be an IP addressable node
   - tens of billions of Internet devices now become trillions
- Clusters can cluster
   - Multi-million node global clusters

## Metcalfe and Olson's mistake was binding the platform with what could be done with it. We never have an inkling. No one knew what could be done with personal computers, no one knew what could be done with the web, no one knew what could be done with smartphones. Let's not repeat that mistake.
